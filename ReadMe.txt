LowKey - Escape from Asgard



Description:
Low-Key - Escape from Asgard is a strategic Puzzle-Game, in which the player
controls Loki, the god of mischief, who took his latest prank one step too far. Now the
gods of Asgard are after him and want him captured, so Loki must evade their sight at all
costs. To do this, the player has to chain together his available moves to create a path for
Loki, such that he does cross the predetermined path of the other gods. When he reaches
the exit, the next Level can begin. To win, the player must guide Loki through all rooms
and out of the premises of Asgard so that he can hide and let his punishment be forgotten
once again.
